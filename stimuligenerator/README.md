####stimuligenerator.py####
Contains all the functions that produce stimuli for each of the options (favoring self, favoring partner, favoring group over self, favoring group over partner). 
This can be modified produce other values (e.g., multiples of 5).

####testing.py####
Runs a bunch of tests to make sure that those functions produce the right stimuli (e.g., that the favoring self condition assigns more to the self than to the other person).

####scripttogeneratestimuli.py####
Generates as many stimuli as we want, and writes it to a .csv file.
