#Numbers from 1-9 and their corresponding factorial [1,2,6,24,120,720,5040,40320,362880]
#Array of digit length? [1,1,1,2,3,3,4,5,6]
#We can use this as min length of string (e.g., if 9 is in the string, the string cannot shorter than 6 digits)
#Test all 2 digit integers
#First pass print a list of numbers that pass the test
