    "I'm going to be looking at some pilot data that some colleagues and I collected using Jon Freeman's Mousetracker (http://www.mousetracker.org/). As the name suggests, mousetracker is a program designed to track participants' mouse movements. In social psychology, researchers use it to track participants' implicit decision making processes. Originally, it was developed to study how individuals categorize faces. An example of the paradigm would be a participant having to choose whether a face is male or female, like so: ![mousetracker image here](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54612594e4b09fab6f870891/546efb6ae4b0923225b792c7/546efb6ce4b0a19016ccac11/1416559468408/p.jpg?format=2500w)\n",
    "\n",
    "The researcher could then vary the degree to which the face has stereotypically male features, or stereotypically female features, and track not just *what* participants are categorizing the faces as, but also, *how* they reach those decisions, by tracking the paths and time course of the mouse movements."

For example, if red poker chips were paid out to you and green to your partner, one dilemma would be choosing between these two stacks of poker chips of equal height (i.e., the group receives the same in both cases):\n",
